    <h1> About Us</h1>
    <p>GloryVET,
       established in 1976, is one of Lagos's largest non-profit
       animal shelters. Since opening our doors, we have placed
       over 145,000 cats and dogs in responsible, loving homes.</p>
       <p>Our Shelter is located a half hour north of Boston and
         is easily accessible from all of New England. We’re
         open 7 days a week to make the adoption of a pet convenient
         for the general public.

        As soon as a dog or cat arrives at our facility, our
       staff begins searching for the right match — a family 
       or individual who will give the pet a wonderful home. 
       While waiting for a forever home, our dogs and cats 
       receive the best of care. Since each animal’s needs 
       are unique, this may include medical care, training 
       with our behavior team, or a special diet. Our pets 
       are inoculated, wormed, and spayed or neutered prior 
       to leaving the Shelter.
        
        Northeast Animal Shelter is proud of our many
       programs, such as Saving Homeless Pets Across 
       America, the Community Pet Food Bank, Foster Care,
       and Senior Visitation. Visit Our Programs Page to 
      learn more about the innovative ways we help animals
     and our community.
        
         
        
        Northeast Animal Shelter receives no local, state
       or federal funding and is entirely dependent on 
       contributions from people like you to cover its
       annual operating budget. Please show your commitment
       to our work and the loving pets we serve. Make a donation today.</p>
