      <h1>It’s National Pet Month!</h1>
        <p>Spring in to action and support
           StreetVet during National Pet Month this April.</p>
           <br>
        <p>We’d like to give thanks to our four-legged
           friends by spending this month honouring them.</p>
           <br>
        <p>Since time at home has increased, every owner knows
           how important their pet is to them, especially
           in tough times. For those experiencing homelessness, 
           a pet can provide support, protection, friendship,
           and a reason to keep going.</p>
           <br>
        <p>We want to celebrate National Pet Month by highlighting the 
          human-animal bond, and the benefits that our special companions
          give us every day.</p>
          <br>
        <p>Meet Macey, she belongs to one of our lovely clients in Cornwall.
           Her owner is so grateful to have her in his life.</p>
           <br>
        <q>Macey picked me. We both needed some company at the time. We bonded,
           and we’ve not separated since. She gives me unconditional love, she’s
           mischievous and cheeky and a real daddy’s girl. She doesn’t leave my side. </q>

        <h1>WELCOME TO <strong>GloryVET</strong></h1>
        <p><em>Homelessness</em> is a growing problem in the Nigeria and an increasing
           number of homeless people have dogs. The bond between many
           homeless people and their dogs is profound and the health
           and wellbeing of their canine companions is often a major
           priority for their owners.</p>
           <br>
        <p>Life on the streets makes it difficult to access the fundamental
           vet care required to ensure the health and vitality these dogs deserve.
           StreetVet is a registered practice with the Royal College of Veterinary
           Surgeons and has been established by a dedicated team of professional
           vets and veterinary nurses to bring that essential care to homeless
           people and their dogs across the capital. Together the StreetVet
           team take their experience out onto the streets of ever expanding
           locations, seeking out people; their dogs living rough,
           and delivering care and support required to ensure their
           combined wellbeing.</p>
        <p>Combined with the critical support of a host of renowned 
          organisations backing our team of qualified professionals,
          StreetVet is changing the future for homeless dogs who may
          otherwise have to go without the care they need and deserve.</p>
